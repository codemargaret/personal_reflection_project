# _Personal Reflection Project_

#### _An reflection on my development as a coder so far, 11.03.2017_

#### By _Margaret Berry_

## Description

_Fourteen weeks into my coding bootcamp, Epicodus gave me a day to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses as a programmer. It was an open-ended assignment to think about my strengths and weaknesses, and to dive into something I need to work on or learn more about._

## My Strengths
* _Clear documentation: my commits and READMEs are generally clear and easy to understand._
* _Attention to detail: I am careful when writing initial code and am often able to find small syntax errors._
* _Affinity for test-driven development: I like the process of writing a test first to clarify my purpose, writing the minimum amount of code to make it pass, and then refactoring._
* _Love of learning: my favorite thing about coding is that I will always be learning new things._
* _Deep understanding of concepts: once I learn a new concept, I generally understand it well and remember it._
* _Clear personal communication: I am usually able to articulate my thinking clearly._
* _Working in a team: I have really enjoyed working with and learning from my classmates at Epicodus. I have generally been able to communicate productively with my teammates both about code and interpersonal dynamics._
* _Working independently: I think I have found a good balance between working through a problem on my own, and knowing when to ask for help._

## My Weaknesses
* _Experience: I had very little coding experience before beginning code school, so many tools and concepts are new to me._
* _Persistence: I have been actively working on this and have gotten much better, but sometimes I still don't stick with a problem long enough._
* _Slower learning curve for conceptual understanding: it takes me a while to learn new concepts._
* _Big picture: I am sometimes able to make code work without a solid understanding of why it works and how the different pieces fit together. Sometimes my learning is also somewhat scattered. I may quickly get a difficult concept while struggling to grasp a more basic one._
* _Intimidated by new things: I am sometimes hesitant to jump into using a completely new tool or library._

## Project Goal
_One of my strengths is that I like to write tests, and one of my weaknesses is being intimidated by new things, so I am going to explore testing in Angular, which is completely new to me. Epicodus teaches students Angular in its JavaScript course, but does not touch on testing in Angular. I'm going to try to write an Angular application from scratch and test it thoroughly. If I have extra time, I will explore debugging tools in Angular, and add Sass to my project. I'm going to start [here](https://angular.io/guide/testing)._
